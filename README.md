# Data Security Project

This project aims to implement encryption and decryption algorithms as part of a college project on data security.

## Project Template (Start-up Code)

You can access the project template [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1gIw831k_70YW9SXt0N9VShXrvoJuQHGE).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

1. Open the `SecurityPackage.sln` file.
2. Download the recommended .NET Framework for the template.
3. Write your implementation for your algorithm.
4. Go to the `Test` tab and choose `Test Explorer`.
5. Right-click on the required algorithm and then choose `Run` to execute all test cases on the chosen one.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Implementation of Encryption, Decryption, and Analysis Functions

The primary goal of this milestone is to implement encryption, decryption, and analysis functions for various cryptographic algorithms. The following algorithms are required to be implemented:

- Ceasar Cipher
- Autokey Vigenère Cipher
- Repeating Key Vigenère Cipher
- Rail Fence Cipher
- Columnar Transposition Cipher
- Monoalphabetic Cipher
- Hill Cipher
- Playfair Cipher

**NOTE:** The implementation of the Playfair Cipher Analysis is marked as "OPTIONAL" and comes with BONUS points, making it non-mandatory.
