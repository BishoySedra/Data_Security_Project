# Data Security Project

This project aims to implement encryption and decryption algorithms as part of a college project on data security.

## Project Template (Start-up Code)

You can access the project template [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1gIw831k_70YW9SXt0N9VShXrvoJuQHGE).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

1. Open the `SecurityPackage.sln` file.
2. Download the recommended .NET Framework for the template.
3. Write your implementation for your algorithm.
4. Go to the `Test` tab and choose `Test Explorer`.
5. Right-click on the required algorithm and then choose `Run` to execute all test cases on the chosen one.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Implementation of Encryption, Decryption, and Analysis Functions

The primary goal of this milestone is to implement encryption, decryption, and analysis functions for various cryptographic algorithms. The following algorithms are required to be implemented:

- Ceasar Cipher
- Autokey Vigenère Cipher
- Repeating Key Vigenère Cipher
- Rail Fence Cipher
- Columnar Transposition Cipher
- Monoalphabetic Cipher
- Hill Cipher
- Playfair Cipher

**NOTE:** The implementation of the Playfair Cipher Analysis is marked as "OPTIONAL" and comes with BONUS points, making it non-mandatory.

### Milestone 2: Implementation of Extended Euclidean, DES, and AES

This milestone focuses on implementing additional encryption and decryption algorithms, including:
- Extended Euclidean
- Data Encryption Standard (DES)
- Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

These algorithms add to the complexity and security of the encryption methods implemented in Milestone 1.

### Milestone 3: Implementation of RSA, Diffie-Hellman, RC4, ElGamal CryptoSystem "OPTIONAL" and MD5 "Possibly BONUS Not Sure"

In this milestone, the focus shifts to implementing more advanced encryption and cryptographic algorithms, including:
- RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)
- Diffie-Hellman key exchange
- RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4)
- ElGamal Cryptosystem

The implementation of these algorithms further enhances the security and versatility of the encryption techniques employed in the project. Additionally, the implementation of MD5 hashing may be considered for bonus points, providing an extra layer of data integrity verification.
