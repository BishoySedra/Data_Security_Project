# Testing Application

The Testing Application is designed to verify the functionality of encryption and decryption algorithms by testing them with various inputs.

## Overview

This application is specifically crafted to ensure that the encryption and decryption algorithms implemented in your project perform as expected under different scenarios and input conditions.

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to set up and run the application:

1. Fill in the `Encrypt` function and `Decrypt` function with your implementations of the encryption and decryption algorithms, respectively.

2. Run the application by pressing `CTRL + F5` or by using your preferred method to compile and execute the code.

Ensure that your implementations are correct and handle all possible inputs effectively.
